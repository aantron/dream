(* Among other things, this module wraps the Logs library so as to prepend
   request ids to log messages.

   However, instead of prepending the id at the front end of Logs, in the
   wrappers, we prepend the id at the back end instead - in the reporter. The
   rationale for this is that we want to (try to) prepend the id even to strings
   that don't come from Dream or the user's Dream app, and thus *definitely* do
   not call this module's wrappers.

   The wrappers try to get the request id from their argument ~request, and pass
   it down to the reporter in a Logs tag.

   The reporter reads the tag and uses that request id if it is available. If
   the request id is not available, it is because the log message comes from a
   point in the Dream app where an id has not been assigned to the request, or
   because the log message comes from another dependency (or a sloppy call
   site!). In that case, the reporter tries to retrieve the id from the
   promise-chain-local storage of Lwt.

   This is sufficient for attaching a request id to most log messages, in
   practice. *)

(* The "back end." I inlined several examples from the Logs, Logs_lwt, and Fmt
   docs into each other, and modified the result, to arrive at this function.
   See those docs for the meanings of the various helpers and values.

   The reporter needs to be suspended in a function because Dream sets up the
   logger lazily; it doesn't query the output streams for whether they are TTYs
   until needed. Setting up the reporter before TTY checking will cause it to
   not output color. *)

     ~over is to be called when the I/O underlying the log operation is fully
     complete. In practice, since most call sites are not using Lwt, they will
     continue executing anyway. This means that the message must be formatted
     and the buffer flushed before doing anything asynchronous, so that
     subsequent logging operations don't get into the same generation of the
     buffer.
