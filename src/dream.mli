(** {1 Types}

    Dream is built on just five types. The first two are the data types of
    Dream. Both are abstract, even though they appear to have definitions: *)

type request = client message
(** HTTP requests, such as [GET /something HTTP/1.1]. See
    {!section-requests}. *)

and response = server message
(** HTTP responses, such as [200 OK]. See {!section-responses}. *)

(** The remaining three types are for building up Web apps. *)

and handler = request -> response
(** Handlers are asynchronous functions from requests to responses. Example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/1-hello#files}
    [1-hello]} \[{{:http://dream.as/1-hello} playground}\] shows the simplest
    handler, an anonymous function which we pass to {!Dream.run}. This creates a
    complete Web server! You can also see the Reason version in example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/r-hello#files}
    [r-hello]}.

    {[
      let () =
        Dream.run (fun _ ->
          Dream.html "Good morning, world!")
    ]} *)

and middleware = handler -> handler
(** Middlewares are functions that take a {!handler}, and run some code before
    or after — producing a “bigger” handler. Example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/2-middleware#files}
    [2-middleware]} inserts the {!Dream.logger} middleware into a Web app:

    {[
      let () =
        Dream.run
        @@ Dream.logger
        @@ fun _ -> Dream.html "Good morning, world!"
    ]}

    Examples
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/4-counter#files}
    [4-counter]} \[{{:http://dream.as/4-counter} playground}\] and
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/5-promise#files}
    [5-promise]} show user-defined middlewares:

    {[
      let count_requests inner_handler request =
        count := !count + 1;
        inner_handler request
    ]}

    In case you are wondering why the example middleware [count_requests] takes
    two arguments, while the type says it should take only one, it's because:

    {[
      middleware
        = handler -> handler
        = handler -> (request -> response promise)
        = handler -> request -> response promise
    ]} *)

and route
(** Routes tell {!Dream.router} which handler to select for each request. See
    {!section-routing} and example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/3-router#files}
    [3-router]} \[{{:http://dream.as/3-router/echo/foo} playground}\]. Routes
    are created by helpers such as {!Dream.get} and {!Dream.scope}:

    {[
      Dream.router [
        Dream.scope "/admin" [Dream.memory_sessions] [
          Dream.get "/" admin_handler;
          Dream.get "/logout" admin_logout_handler;
        ];
      ]
    ]} *)

(** {2 Algebra}

    The three handler-related types have a vaguely algebraic interpretation:

    - Each literal {!handler} is an atom.
    - {!type-middleware} is for sequential composition (product-like).
      {!Dream.no_middleware} is {b 1}.
    - {!type-route} is for alternative composition (sum-like). {!Dream.no_route}
      is {b 0}.

    {!Dream.scope} implements a left distributive law, making Dream a ring-like
    structure. *)

(** {2 Helpers} *)

and 'a message = 'a Dream_pure.Message.message
(** ['a message], pronounced “any message,” allows some functions to take either
    {!type-request} or {!type-response} as arguments, because both are defined
    in terms of ['a message]. For example, in {!section-headers}:

    {[
      val Dream.header : string -> 'a message -> string option
    ]} *)

and client = Dream_pure.Message.client
and server = Dream_pure.Message.server
(** Type parameters for {!message} for {!type-request} and {!type-response},
    respectively. These are “phantom” types. They have no meaning other than
    they are different from each other. Dream only ever creates [client message]
    and [server message]. [client] and [server] are never mentioned again in the
    docs. *)
(* TODO These docs need to be clarified. *)
(* TODO Hide all the Dream_pure type equalities. *)

and 'a promise = 'a Lwt.t
(** Dream uses {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt} Lwt} for promises and
    asynchronous I/O. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/5-promise#files}
    [5-promise]} \[{{:http://dream.as/5-promise} playground}\].

    Use [raise] to reject promises. If you are writing a library, you may prefer
    using
    {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/blob/9943ba77a5508feaea5e1fb60b011db4179f9c61/src/core/lwt.mli#L459}
    [Lwt.fail]} in some places, in order to avoid clobbering your user's current
    exception backtrace — though, in most cases, you should still extend it with
    [raise] and [let%lwt], instead. *)

    [~status] are two ways to specify the {!type-status} code, which is [200 OK]
    by default. The headers are empty by default.

    Note that browsers may interpret lack of a [Content-Type:] header as if its
    value were [application/octet-stream] or [text/html; charset=us-ascii],
    which will prevent correct interpretation of UTF-8 strings. Either add a
    [Content-Type:] header using [~headers] or {!Dream.add_header}, or use a
    wrapper like {!Dream.html}. The modern [Content-Type:] for HTML is
    [text/html; charset=utf-8]. See {!Dream.text_html}. *)

val respond :
  ?status:[< status ] ->
  ?code:int ->
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    string -> response
(** Same as {!Dream.val-response}, but the new {!type-response} is wrapped in a
    {!type-promise}. *)

val html :
  ?status:[< status ] ->
  ?code:int ->
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    string -> response
(** Same as {!Dream.respond}, but adds [Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8].
    See {!Dream.text_html}.

    As your Web app develops, consider adding [Content-Security-Policy] headers,
    as described in example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/w-content-security-policy#files}
    [w-content-security-policy]}. These headers are completely optional, but
    they can provide an extra layer of defense for a mature app. *)

val json :
  ?status:[< status ] ->
  ?code:int ->
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    string -> response
(** Same as {!Dream.respond}, but adds [Content-Type: application/json]. See
    {!Dream.application_json}. *)

val redirect :
  ?status:[< redirection ] ->
  ?code:int ->
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    request -> string -> response
(** Creates a new {!type-response}. Adds a [Location:] header with the given
    string. The default status code is [303 See Other], for a temporary
    redirection. Use [~status:`Moved_Permanently] or [~code:301] for a permanent
    redirection.

    If you use [~code], be sure the number follows the pattern [3xx], or most
    browsers and other clients won't actually perform a redirect.

    The {!type-request} is used for retrieving the site prefix, if the string is
    an absolute path. Most applications don't have a site prefix. *)

val empty :
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    status -> response
(** Same as {!Dream.val-response} with the empty string for a body. *)

val stream :
  ?status:[< status ] ->
  ?code:int ->
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    request -> (response -> unit) -> response
(** Same as {!Dream.val-respond}, but calls {!Dream.set_stream} internally to
    prepare the response for stream writing, and then runs the callback
    asynchronously to do it. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/j-stream#files}
    [j-stream]}.

    {[
      fun request ->
        Dream.stream request (fun response ->
          Dream.write response "foo";
          Dream.close_stream response)
    ]} *)

val websocket :
  ?headers:(string * string) list ->
    request -> (response -> unit) -> response
(** Creates a fresh [101 Switching Protocols] response. Once this response is
    returned to Dream's HTTP layer, the callback is passed a new
    {!type-websocket}, and the application can begin using it. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/k-websocket#files}

(** {1 Cookies}

    {!Dream.set_cookie} and {!Dream.cookie} are designed for round-tripping
    secure cookies. The most secure settings applicable to the current server
    are inferred automatically. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/c-cookie#files}
    [c-cookie]} \[{{:http://dream.as/c-cookie} playground}\].

    {[
      Dream.set_cookie "my.cookie" "foo" request response
      Dream.cookie "my.cookie" request
    ]}

    The {!Dream.cookie} call evaluates to [Some "foo"], but the actual cookie
    that is exchanged may look like:

    {v
__Host-my.cookie=AL7NLA8-so3e47uy0R5E2MpEQ0TtTWztdhq5pTEUT7KSFg; \
  Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
    v}

    {!Dream.set_cookie} has a large number of optional arguments for tweaking
    the inferred security settings. If you use them, pass the same arguments to
    {!Dream.cookie} to automatically undo the result. *)

val set_cookie :
  ?prefix:[< `Host | `Secure ] option ->
  ?encrypt:bool ->
  ?expires:float ->
  ?max_age:float ->
  ?domain:string ->
  ?path:string option ->
  ?secure:bool ->
  ?http_only:bool ->
  ?same_site:[< `Strict | `Lax | `None ] option ->
    response -> string -> string -> request -> unit
(** Appends a [Set-Cookie:] header to the {!type-response}. Infers the most
    secure defaults from the {!type-request}.

    {[
      Dream.set_cookie "my.cookie" "value" request response
    ]}

    Specify {!Dream.run} argument [~secret], or the Web app will not be able to
    decrypt cookies from prior starts.

    See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/c-cookie#files}
    [c-cookie]}.

    Most of the optional arguments are for overriding inferred defaults.
    [~expires] and [~max_age] are independently useful. In particular, to delete
    a cookie, use [~expires:0.]

    - [~prefix] sets [__Host-], [__Secure-], or no prefix, from most secure to
      least. A conforming client will refuse to accept the cookie if [~domain],
      [~path], and [~secure] don't match the constraints implied by the prefix.
      By default, {!Dream.set_cookie} chooses the most restrictive prefix based
      on the other settings and the {!type-request}. See
      {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-07#section-4.1.3}
      RFC 6265bis §4.1.3} and
      {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Cookie_prefixes}
      MDN}.
    - [~encrypt:false] disables cookie encryption. In that case, you must make
      sure that the cookie value does not contain [=], [;], or newlines. The
      easiest way to do so is to pass the value through an encoder like
      {!Dream.to_base64url}. See {!Dream.run} argument [~secret].
    - [~expires] sets the [Expires=] attribute. The value is compatible with
      {{:https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Unix.html#VALgettimeofday}
      [Unix.gettimeofday]}. See

    Responds with [400 Bad Request] if the check fails. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/e-json#security}
    [e-json]}.

    Implements the
    {{:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#verifying-origin-with-standard-headers}
    OWASP {i Verifying Origin With Standard Headers}} CSRF defense-in-depth
    technique, which is good enough for basic usage. Do not allow [`GET] or
    [`HEAD] requests to trigger important side effects if relying only on
    {!Dream.origin_referrer_check}.

    Future extensions to this function may use [X-Forwarded-Host] or host
    whitelists.

    For more thorough protection, generate CSRF tokens with {!Dream.csrf_token},
    send them to the client (for instance, in [<meta>] tags of a single-page
    application), and require their presence in an [X-CSRF-Token:] header. *)



(** {1 Forms}

    {!Dream.form_tag} and {!Dream.val-form} round-trip secure forms.
    {!Dream.form_tag} is used inside a template to generate a form header with a
    CSRF token:

    {[
      <%s! Dream.form_tag ~action:"/" request %>
        <input name="my.field">
      </form>
    ]}

    {!Dream.val-form} recieves the form and checks the CSRF token:

    {[
      match%lwt Dream.form request with
      | `Ok ["my.field", value] -> (* ... *)
      | _ -> Dream.empty `Bad_Request
    ]}

    See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/d-form#files}
    [d-form]} \[{{:http://dream.as/d-form} playground}\]. *)

type 'a form_result = [
  | `Ok            of 'a
  | `Expired       of 'a * float
  | `Wrong_session of 'a
  | `Invalid_token of 'a
  | `Missing_token of 'a
  | `Many_tokens   of 'a
  | `Wrong_content_type
]
(** Form CSRF checking results, in order from least to most severe. See
    {!Dream.val-form} and example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/d-form#files}
    [d-form]}.

    The first three constructors, [`Ok], [`Expired], and [`Wrong_session] can
    occur in regular usage.

    The remaining constructors, [`Invalid_token], [`Missing_token],
    [`Many_tokens], [`Wrong_content_type] correspond to bugs, suspicious
    activity, or tokens so old that decryption keys have since been rotated on
    the server. *)

val form : ?csrf:bool -> request -> (string * string) list form_result
(** Parses the request body as a form. Performs CSRF checks. Use
    {!Dream.form_tag} in a template to transparently generate forms that will
    pass these checks. See {!section-templates} and example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/d-form#readme}
    [d-form]}.

    - [Content-Type:] must be [application/x-www-form-urlencoded].
    - The form must have a field named [dream.csrf]. {!Dream.form_tag} adds such
      a field.
    - {!Dream.form} calls {!Dream.verify_csrf_token} to check the token in
      [dream.csrf].

    The call must be done under a session middleware, since each CSRF token is
    scoped to a session. See {!section-sessions}.

    Form fields are sorted for easy pattern matching:

    {[
      match%lwt Dream.form request with
      | `Ok ["email", email; "name", name] -> (* ... *)
      | _ -> Dream.empty `Bad_Request
    ]}

    To recover from conditions like expired forms, add extra cases:

    {[
      match%lwt Dream.form request with
      | `Ok      ["email", email; "name", name] -> (* ... *)
      | `Expired ["email", email; "name", name] -> (* ... *)
      | _ -> Dream.empty `Bad_Request
    ]}

    It is recommended not to mutate state or send back sensitive data in the
    [`Expired] and [`Wrong_session] cases, as they {e may} indicate an attack
    against a client.

    The remaining cases, including unexpected field sets and the remaining
    constructors of {!Dream.type-form_result}, usually indicate either bugs or
    attacks. It's usually fine to respond to all of them with [400 Bad
    Request]. *)

(** {2 Upload} *)

type multipart_form =
  (string * ((string option * string) list)) list
(** Submitted file upload forms, [<form enctype="multipart/form-data">]. For
    example, if a form

    {v
<input name="files" type="file" multiple>
<input name="text">
    v}

    is submitted with two files and a text value, it will be received by
    {!Dream.multipart} as

    {[
      [
        "files", [
          Some "file1.ext", "file1-content";
          Some "file2.ext", "file2-content";
        ];
        "text", [
          None, "text-value"
        ];
      ]
    ]}

    See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/g-upload#files}
    [g-upload]} \[{{:http://dream.as/g-upload} playground}\] and
    {{:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7578} RFC 7578}.

    Note that clients such as curl can send files with no filename ([None]),
    though most browsers seem to insert at least an empty filename ([Some ""]).
    Don't use use the presence of a filename to determine if the field value is
    a file. Use the field name and knowledge about the form instead.

    If a file field has zero files when submitted, browsers send
    ["field-name", [Some ""; ""]]. {!Dream.multipart} replaces this with
    ["field-name", []]. Use the advanced interface {!Dream.upload} for the raw
    behavior.

    Non-file fields always have one value, which might be the empty string.

    See
    {{:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html}
    OWASP {i File Upload Cheat Sheet}} for security precautions for upload
    forms. *)

val multipart : ?csrf:bool -> request -> multipart_form form_result
(** Like {!Dream.form}, but also reads files, and [Content-Type:] must be
    [multipart/form-data]. The [<form>] tag and CSRF token can be generated in a
    template with

    {[
      <%s! Dream.form_tag ~action:"/"
             ~enctype:`Multipart_form_data request %>
    ]}

    See {!Dream.form_tag}, section {!section-templates}, and example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/g-upload#files}
    [g-upload]}.

    Note that, like {!Dream.form}, this function sorts form fields by field
    name.

    {!Dream.multipart} reads entire files into memory, so it is only suitable
    for prototyping, or with yet-to-be-added file size and count limits. See
    {!Dream.val-upload} below for a streaming version. *)

(** {2 Streaming uploads} *)

type part = string option * string option * ((string * string) list)
(** Upload form parts.

    A value [Some (name, filename, headers)] received by {!Dream.val-upload}
    begins a {e part} in the stream. A part represents either a form field, or
    a single, complete file.

    Note that, in the general case, [filename] and [headers] are not reliable.
    [name] is the form field name. *)

val upload : request -> part option
(** Retrieves the next upload part.

    Upon getting [Some (name, filename, headers)] from this function, the user
    should call {!Dream.upload_part} to stream chunks of the part's data, until
    that function returns [None]. The user should then call {!Dream.val-upload}
    again. [None] from {!Dream.val-upload} indicates that all parts have been
    received.

    {!Dream.upload} does not verify a CSRF token. There are several ways to add
    CSRF protection for an upload stream, including:

    - Generate the form with {!Dream.form_tag}. Check for
      [`Field ("dream.csrf", token)] during upload and call
      {!Dream.verify_csrf_token}.
    - Use {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData}
      [FormData]} in the client to submit [multipart/form-data] by AJAX, and
      include a custom header. *)

val upload_part : request -> string option
(** Retrieves a part chunk. *)

(** {2 CSRF tokens}

    It's usually not necessary to handle CSRF tokens directly.

    - Form tag generator {!Dream.form_tag} generates and inserts a CSRF token
      that {!Dream.val-form} and {!Dream.val-multipart} transparently verify.
    - AJAX can be protected from CSRF by {!Dream.origin_referrer_check}.

    CSRF functions are exposed for creating custom schemes, and for
    defense-in-depth purposes. See
    {{:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html}
    OWASP {i Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet}}. *)

type csrf_result = [
  | `Ok
  | `Expired of float
  | `Wrong_session
  | `Invalid
]
(** CSRF token verification outcomes.

    [`Expired] and [`Wrong_session] can occur in normal usage, when a user's
    form or session expire, respectively. However, they can also indicate
    attacks, including stolen tokens, stolen tokens from other sessions, or
    attempts to use a token from an invalidated pre-session after login.

    [`Invalid] indicates a token with a bad signature, a payload that was not
    generated by Dream, or other serious errors that cannot usually be triggered
    by normal users. [`Invalid] usually corresponds to bugs or attacks.
    [`Invalid] can also occur for very old tokens after old keys are no longer
    in use on the server. *)

val csrf_token : ?valid_for:float -> request -> string
(** Returns a fresh CSRF token bound to the given request's and signed with the
    [~secret] given to {!Dream.run}. [~valid_for] is the token's lifetime, in
    seconds. The default value is one hour ([3600.]). Dream uses signed tokens
    that are not stored server-side. *)

val verify_csrf_token : request -> string -> csrf_result promise
(** Checks that the CSRF token is valid for the {!type-request}'s session. *)



(** {1 Templates}

    Dream includes a template preprocessor that allows interleaving OCaml and
    HTML in the same file:

    {v
let render message =
  <html>
    <body>
      <p>The message is <b><%s message %></b>!</p>
    </body>
  </html>
    v}

    See examples
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/7-template#files}
    [7-template]} \[{{:http://dream.as/7-template} playground}\] and
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/r-template#files}
    [r-template]} \[{{:http://dream.as/r-template} playground}\].

    There is also a typed alternative, provided by an external library,
    {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml} TyXML}. It is shown in example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/w-tyxml#files}
    [w-tyxml]} \[{{:http://dream.as/w-tyxml} playground}\]. If you are using
    Reason syntax, TyXML can be used with
    {{:https://ocsigen.org/tyxml/latest/manual/jsx} server-side JSX}. See
    example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/r-tyxml#files}
    [r-tyxml]} \[{{:http://dream.as/r-tyxml} playground}\].

    To use the built-in templates, add this to [dune]:

    {v
(rule
 (targets template.ml)
 (deps template.eml.ml)
 (action (run dream_eml %{deps} --workspace %{workspace_root})))
    v}

    A template begins...

    - {e Implicitly} on a line that starts with [<], perhaps with leading
      whitespace. The line is part of the template.
    - {e Explicitly} after a line that starts with [%%]. The [%%] line is not
      part of the template.

    A [%%] line can also be used to set template options. The only option
    supported presently is [%% response] for streaming the template using
    {!Dream.write}, to a {!type-response} that is in scope. This is shown in
    examples
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/w-template-stream#files}
    [w-template-stream]} and
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/r-template-stream#files}
    [r-template-stream]}.

    A template ends...

    - {e Implicitly}, when the indentation level is less than that of the
      beginning line.
    - {e Explicitly} on a line that starts with another [%%].

    Everything outside a template is ordinary OCaml code.

    OCaml code can also be inserted into a template:

    - [<%s code %>] expects [code] to evaluate to a [string], and inserts the
      [string] into the template.
    - A line that begins with [%] in the first column is OCaml code inside the
      template. Its value is not inserted into the template. Indeed, it can be
      fragments of control-flow constructs.
    - [<% code %>] is a variant of [%] that can be used for short snippets
      within template lines.

    The [s] in [<%s code %>] is actually a
    {{:https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Printf.html}
    Printf}-style format specification. So, for example, one can print two hex
    digits using [<%02X code %>].

    [<%s code %>] automatically escapes the result of [code] using
    {!Dream.html_escape}. This can be suppressed with [!]. [<%s! code %>] prints
    the result of [code] literally. {!Dream.html_escape} is only safe for use in
    HTML text and quoted attribute values. It does not offer XSS protection in
    unquoted attribute values, CSS in [<style>] tags, or literal JavaScript in
    [<script>] tags. *)

val form_tag :
  ?method_:[< method_ ] ->
  ?target:string ->
  ?enctype:[< `Multipart_form_data ] ->
  ?csrf_token:bool ->
    action:string -> request -> string
(** Generates a [<form>] tag and an [<input>] tag with a CSRF token, suitable
    for use with {!Dream.val-form} and {!Dream.val-multipart}. For example, in
    a template,

    {[
      <%s! Dream.form_tag ~action:"/" request %>
        <input name="my.field">
      </form>
    ]}

    expands to

    {[
      <form method="POST" action="/">
        <input name="dream.csrf" type="hidden" value="a-token">
        <input name="my.field">
      </form>
    ]}

    [~method] sets the method used to submit the form. The default is [`POST].

    [~target] adds a [target] attribute. For example, [~target:"_blank"] causes
    the browser to submit the form in a new tab or window.

    Pass [~enctype:`Multipart_form_data] for a file upload form.

    [~csrf_token:false] suppresses generation of the [dream.csrf] field. *)

val router : route list -> middleware
(** Creates a router. Besides interpreting routes, a router is a middleware

    [**] causes the request's path to be trimmed by the route prefix, and the
    request's prefix to be extended by it. It is mainly useful for “mounting”
    {!Dream.static} as a subsite.

    It can also be used as an escape hatch to convert a handler, which may
    include its own router, into a subsite. However, it is better to compose
    sites with routes and {!Dream.scope} rather than opaque handlers and [**],
    because, in the future, it may be possible to query routes for site
    structure metadata. *)

    components. If these checks fail, {!Dream.static} responds with [404 Not

    If the checks succeed, {!Dream.static} calls [~loader local_directory path
    request], where

    - [local_directory] is the same directory that was passed to
      {!Dream.static}.
    - [path] is what was substituted for [**].

    The default loader is {!Dream.from_filesystem}. See example

    However, if the result is [text/html], {!Dream.mime_lookup} replaces it with
    [text/html; charset=utf-8], so as to match {!Dream.html}. *)



(** {1 Sessions}

    Dream's default sessions contain string-to-string dictionaries for
    application data. For example, a logged-in session might have

    {[
      [
        "user", "someone";
        "lang", "ut-OP";
      ]
    ]}

    Sessions also have three pieces of metadata:

    - {!Dream.session_id}
    - {!Dream.session_label}
    - {!Dream.session_expires_at}

    There are several back ends, which decide where the sessions are stored:

    - {!Dream.memory_sessions}
    - {!Dream.sql_sessions}
    - {!Dream.cookie_sessions}

    All requests passing through session middleware are assigned a session,
    either an existing one, or a new empty session, known as a {e pre-session}.

    When a session is at least half-expired, it is automatically refreshed by
    the next request that it is assigned to.

    See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/b-session#files}
    [b-session]} \[{{:http://dream.as/b-session} playground}\]. *)

val session : string -> request -> string option
(** Value from the request's session. *)

val put_session : string -> string -> request -> unit
(** Mutates a value in the request's session. The back end may commit the value
    to storage immediately, so this function returns a promise. *)

val all_session_values : request -> (string * string) list

    pre-session. *)

val session_label : request -> string

val session_expires_at : request -> float
(** Time at which the session will expire. *)



(** {1 Flash messages}

    Flash messages are short strings which are stored in cookies during one
    request, to be made available for the next request. The typical use case is
    to provide form feedback across a redirect. See example
    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/w-flash#files}
    [w-flash]} \[{{:http://dream.as/w-flash} playground}\]. *)

val flash_messages : middleware

    {{:https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/h-sql#files}
    [h-sql]} \[{{:http://dream.as/h-sql} playground}\].

    Dream installs the core {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/caqti/} [caqti]}
    package, but you should also install at least one of:

    - {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/caqti-driver-sqlite3/}
      [caqti-driver-sqlite3]}
    - {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/caqti-driver-postgresql/}

    - {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/caqti-driver-mariadb/}
      [caqti-driver-mariadb]}

    They are separated because each has its own system library dependencies.
    Regardless of which you install, usage on the OCaml level is the same. The
    differences are in SQL syntax, and in external SQL server or file setup. See

    Dream initializes its logging back end lazily. This is so that if a Dream

    This also allows the Web app to give logging settings explicitly by calling

      [Lwt.async_exception_hook]} so as to forward all asynchronous exceptions
      to the logger, and not terminate the process.

val set_log_level : string -> [< log_level ] -> unit
(** Set the log level threshold of the given sub-log. *)



(** {1 Errors}

    Dream passes all errors to a single error handler, including...

    - exceptions and rejected promises from the application,
    - [4xx] and [5xx] responses from the application, and
    - lower-level errors, such as TLS handshake failures and malformed HTTP
      requests.

    This allows customizing error handling in one place. Including low-level
    errors prevents leakage of strings in automatic responses not under the
    application's control, for full internationalization.

    Use {!Dream.error_template} and pass the result to {!Dream.run}
    [~error_handler] to customize the error template.

    The default error handler logs errors and its template generates
    completely empty responses, to avoid internationalization issues. In
    addition, this conforms to the recommendations in
    {{:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html}
    OWASP {i Error Handling Cheat Sheet}}.

    For full control over error handling, including logging, you can define an
    {!type-error_handler} directly. *)

type error = {
  condition : [
    | `Response of response
    | `String of string
    | `Exn of exn

(** Detailed errors. Ignore this type if only using {!Dream.error_template}.

    {ul
    {li
    [condition] describes the error itself.

    - [`Response] is a [4xx] or [5xx] response.
    - [`String] is an error that has only an English-language description.
    - [`Exn] is a caught exception.

    The default error handler logs [`Exn] and [`Strings], but not [`Response].
    [`Response] is assumed to be deliberate, and already logged by
    {!Dream.logger}.
    }

    {li
    [layer] is which part of the Dream stack detected the error.

    - [`App] is for application exceptions, rejections, and [4xx], [5xx]
      responses.
    - [`HTTP] and [`HTTP2] are for low-level HTTP protocol errors.
    - [`TLS] is for low-level TLS errors.
    - [`WebSocket] is for WebSocket errors.

    The default error handler uses this to just prepend a prefix to its log
    messages.
    }

    {li
    [caused_by] is the party likely to have caused the error.

    - [`Server] errors suggest bugs, and correspond to [5xx] responses.

    [request] is a {!type-request} associated with the error, if there is one.

    As examples, a request might not be available if the error is a failure to

    In case of a [`WebSocket] error, the request is the client's original
    request to establish the WebSocket connection.
    }

    {li
    [response] is a {!type-response} that was either generated by the
    application, or suggested by the error context.

    In case of a [`WebSocket] error, the response is the application's original
    connection agreement response created by {!Dream.val-websocket}.

type error_handler = error -> response option
(** Error handlers log errors and convert them into responses. Ignore if using
    {!Dream.error_template}.

    If the error has [will_send_response = true], the error handler must return
    a response. Otherwise, it should return [None].

    If an error handler raises an exception or rejects, Dream logs this
    secondary failure. If the error context needs a response, Dream responds
    with an empty [500 Internal Server Error].

    The behavior of Dream's default error handler is described at
    {!Dream.type-error}. *)
(* TODO Get rid of the option? *)

val error_template :
  (error -> string -> response -> response) -> error_handler
(** Builds an {!error_handler} from a template. See example

    ]}

    The error's context suggests a response. Usually, its only valid field is
    {!Dream.val-status}.

    - If the error is an exception or rejection from the application, the status
      is usually [500 Internal Server Error].
    - In case of a [4xx] or [5xx] response from the application, that response
      itself is passed to the template.
    - For low-level errors, the status is typically either [400 Bad Request] if
      the error was likely caused by the client, and [500 Internal Server Error]
      if the error was likely caused by the server.

    [~debug_dump] is a multi-line string containing an error description, stack
    trace, request state, and other information.

    When an error occurs in a context where a response is not possible, the
    template is not called. In some contexts where the template is called, the
    status code is hardcoded, but the headers and body from the template's
    response will still be used.

    If the template itself raises an exception or rejects, an empty [500
    Internal Server Error] will be sent in contexts that require a response. *)

    [Lwt_main.run]} internally, so it is intended to be the main loop of a
    program. {!Dream.serve} is a version that does not call [Lwt_main.run].

    - [~interface] is the network interface to listen on. Defaults to
      ["localhost"]. Use ["0.0.0.0"] to listen on all interfaces.
    - [~port] is the port to listen on. Defaults to [8080].
    - [~debug:true] enables debug information in error templates. See
      {!Dream.error_template}. The default is [false], to prevent accidental

(** {2:builtin Built-in middleware}

    Built-in middleware is Dream functionality that is implemented as middleware
    for maintainability reasons. It is necessary for Dream to work correctly.
    However, because it is middleware, Dream allows replacing it with
    {!Dream.run} [~builtins:false]. The middleware is applied in documented
    order, so

    {[
      Dream.run my_app
    ]}

    is the same as

    {[
      Dream.run ~builtins:false
      @@ Dream.lowercase_headers
      @@ Dream.content_length
      @@ Dream.catch ~error_handler
      @@ my_app
    ]}

    The middleware can be replaced with work-alikes, or omitted to use Dream as
    a fairly raw abstraction layer over low-level HTTP libraries. *)

val lowercase_headers : middleware
(** Lowercases response headers for HTTP/2 requests. *)

val content_length : middleware
(** If the request has {!Dream.version} [(1, _)], then...

    - if the response does not have [Content-Length:] and the body is a string,
      sets [Content-Length:] to the string's length, or
    - if the response does not have [Transfer-Encoding:] and the body is a
      stream, sets [Transfer-Encoding: chunked].

    This is built in because an application cannot be expected to decide
    including these headers in the face of transparent HTTP/2 upgrades. The
    headers are necessary in HTTP/1, and forbidden or redundant and difficult to
    use in HTTP/2. *)

val with_site_prefix : string -> middleware
(** Removes the given prefix from the path in each request, and adds it to the

    This is for applications that are not running at the root ([/]) of their
    domain. The default is ["/"], for no prefix. After [with_site_prefix],
    routing is done relative to the prefix, and the prefix is also necessary for
    emitting secure cookies. *)

    Use [~international:false] for compatibility with legacy systems, or when
    constructing URL fragments from untrusted input that may not match the

val split_target : string -> string * string
(** Splits a request target into a path and a query string. *)

val from_path : string -> string list
(** Splits the string into components on [/] and percent-decodes each component.
    Empty components are dropped, except for the last. This function does not

    - [Dream.from_path "a//b"] becomes [["a"; "b"]].

    This function is not for use on full targets, because they may incldue query

(** Percent-encodes a list of path components and joins them with [/] into a
    path. Empty components, except for the last, are removed. The path is
    absolute by default. Use [~relative:true] for a relative path.
    {!Dream.to_path} uses an IRI-friendly percent encoder, which preserves UTF-8
    bytes in unencoded form. Use [~international:false] to percent-encode those

(** {1 Cryptography} *)

val set_secret : ?old_secrets:string list -> string -> middleware
(** Sets a key to be used for cryptographic operations, such as signing CSRF
    tokens and encrypting cookies.

    If this middleware is not used, a random secret is generated the first time
    a secret is needed. The random secret persists for the lifetime of the
    process. This is useful for quick testing and prototyping, but it means that
    restarts of the server will not be able to verify tokens or decrypt cookies
    generated by earlier runs, and multiple servers in a load-balancing
    arrangement will not accept each others' tokens and cookies.

    For production, generate a 256-bit key with

    {[
      Dream.to_base64url (Dream.random 32)
    ]}

    [~old_secrets] is a list of previous secrets that will not be used for
    encryption or signing, but will still be tried for decryption and
    verification. This is intended for key rotation. A medium-sized Web app
    serving 1000 fresh encrypted cookies per second should rotate keys about
    once a year. *)

val random : int -> string
(** Generates the requested number of bytes using a
    {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto} cryptographically secure random
    number generator}. *)

val encrypt :
  ?associated_data:string ->
    request -> string -> string
(** Signs and encrypts the string using the [~secret] in the request. See
    {!Dream.run} for setting [~secret].

    [~associated_data] is included when computing the signature, but not
    included in the ciphertext. It can be used like a “salt,” to force
    ciphertexts from different contexts to be distinct, and dependent on the
    context.

    For example, when {!Dream.set_cookie} encrypts cookie values, it internally
    passes the cookie names in the associated data. This makes it impossible (or
    impractical) to use the ciphertext from one cookie as the value of another.
    The associated data will not match, and the value will be recognized as
    invalid.

    The cipher presently used by Dream is
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116#section-5.2} AEAD_AES_256_GCM}. It
    will be replaced by
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452} AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV} as soon as the
    latter is {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/issues/111} available}.
    The upgrade will be transparent, because Dream includes a cipher rotation
    scheme.

    The cipher is suitable for encrypted transmissions and storing data other
    than credentials. For password or other credential storage, see package
    {{:https://github.com/Khady/ocaml-argon2} [argon2]}. See
    {{:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html}
