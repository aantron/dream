Dream is **one flat module** in **one package**, documented on
[**one page**][api-main], but with [**many examples**][tutorial]. It offers:

- [**WebSockets**][websocket] and [**GraphQL**][graphql] for your modern Web
  apps.
- [**HTML templates**][templates] with embedded OCaml or
  [Reason][reason-templates] &mdash; use existing skills!
- [**Sessions**][sessions] with pluggable storage [back ends][back-ends].
- Easy [**HTTPS** and **HTTP/2** support][https] &mdash; Dream runs without a
  proxy.
- Helpers for [**secure cookies**][cookies] and
  [**CSRF-safe forms**][forms].
- **Full-stack ML** with clients compiled by [**Melange**][melange],
  [**ReScript**][rescript], or [**js_of_ocaml**][jsoo].

<br>

...all without sacrificing ease of use &mdash; Dream has:

- A simple programming model &mdash; Web apps are [**just functions**][handler]!
- Composable [**middleware**][middleware] and [**routes**][routing].
- Unified, internationalization-friendly [**error handling**][errors].
- [**Cryptography**][crypto] helpers, key rotation, and a chosen cipher.
- A neat [**logger**][logging], and attention to configuring the OCaml runtime
  nicely.
- [**Deployment**][deploy] instructions for **Digital Ocean**, **Heroku**, and
  **Fly.io**, with sample CI scripts.

<br>

Every part of the API is arranged to be easy to understand, use, and remember.
Dream sticks to base OCaml types like `string` and `list`, introducing only a
few [types][types] of its own &mdash; and some of those are just abbreviations
for bare functions!

The neat interface is not a limitation. Everything is still configurable by a
large number of optional arguments, and very loose coupling. Where necessary,
Dream exposes the lower-level machinery that it is composed from. For example,
the basic body and WebSocket readers [return strings][basic-read], but you can
also do [zero-copy streaming][streaming].

You can even run Dream as a [quite bare abstraction][raw] over its [underlying
set of HTTP libraries][vendor], where it acts only as minimal glue code between
their slightly different interfaces.

And, even though Dream is presented as one package for ordinary usage, it is
internally factored into [several sub-libraries][libs], according to the
different dependencies of each, for fast porting to different environments.

Dream is a low-level and unopinionated framework, and you can swap out its
conveniences. For example, you can use TyXML with [server-side JSX][jsx]
instead of Dream's built-in templates. You can bundle assets into a [single
Dream binary][one-binary], or use Dream in a subcommand. Dream tries to be as
functional as possible, touching global runtime state only lazily, when called
into.

## Quick start

You can get
[one](https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/2-middleware#folders-and-files)
of the first [tutorials][tutorial] and build it locally with:

<pre><b>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aantron/dream/master/example/quickstart.sh)"</b></pre>

### opam

Create a project directory with an optional local switch:

```
mkdir project
cd project
opam switch create . 5.1.0
eval $(opam env)
```

Install Dream:

```
opam install dream
```

After that, go to any of the [examples][tutorial], such as
[**`2-middleware`**][2-middleware], re-create the files locally, and run it:

```
dune exec ./middleware.exe
```

[esy]: https://esy.sh/
[2-middleware]: https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/2-middleware#folders-and-files

## esy

Visit any of the [examples][tutorial], such as
[**`2-middleware`**][2-middleware], and re-create the files locally. The file
[`esy.json`](https://github.com/aantron/dream/blob/master/example/2-middleware/esy.json)
shows how to depend on Dream. All of the examples are installed by running `npx
esy`, and started with `npx esy start`.

## Acknowledgements

Dream is based on work by the authors and contributors of its [**many
dependencies**][opamfile] and their transitive dependencies. There are, however,
several influences that cannot be discovered directly:

- Templates are inspired by [**ECaml**][ecaml] from [Alexander Markov][komar]
  and [**Embedded OCaml Templates**][eot] from [Emile Trotignon][trotignon].
- Dream's handler and middleware types are simplified from [**Opium**][opium] by
  [Rudi Grinberg][rgrinberg] and contributors.
- The lower-level HTTP and WebSocket servers are [vendored][vendor] copies of
  [Antonio Nuno Monteiro][anmonteiro]'s forks and original works, with credit
  also due to their contributors, and [Spiros Eliopoulos][seliopou] in
  particular, as the original author of two of the projects.
- The API docs are instantiated by [**Soupault**][soupault] from
  [Daniil Baturin][dmbaturin].
- The name was inspired by [**Morph**][morph] from [Ulrik Strid][ulrikstrid],
  which was itself partially inspired by [Opium][opium].
- [Raphael Rafatpanah][persianturtle] and [El-Hassan Wanas][foocraft] provided
  important early feedback.
