description: """
Dream is a feature-complete Web framework with a simple programming
model and no boilerplate. It provides only two data types, request and
response.

Almost everything else is either a built-in OCaml type, or an
abbreviation for a bare function. For example, a Web app, known in
Dream as a handler, is just an ordinary function from requests to
responses. And a middleware is then just a function from handlers to
handlers.

Within this model, Dream adds:

- Session management with pluggable back ends.
- A fully composable router.
- Support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTPS.
- WebSockets.
- GraphQL, including subscriptions and a built-in GraphiQL editor.
- SQL connection pool helpers.
- Server-side HTML templates.
- Automatic secure handling of cookies and forms.
- Unified, internationalization-friendly error handling.
- A neat log, and OCaml runtime configuration.
- Helpers for Web formats, such as Base64url, and a modern cipher.

Because of the simple programming model, everything is optional and
composable. It is trivailly possible to strip Dream down to just a
bare driver of the various HTTP protocols.

Dream is presented as a single module, whose API is documented on one
page. In addition, Dream comes with a large number of examples.
Security topics are introduced throughout, wherever they are
applicable."""
