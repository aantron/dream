# `z-docker-opam`

<br>

This example wraps a very simple Web app in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
container, and runs it persistently, as a daemon.

It is an variant of `z-docker` with Opam as a package manager instead of Esy.
Please see `z-docker`'s README for an in-depth guide on how to configure a Digital Ocean droplet and the commands to deploy.
