# `z-playground`

<br>

This “example” is, in fact, the Dream online playground, running at
[http://dream.as](http://dream.as).

It's a simple, one-page app that uses a WebSocket to communicates with its
server. The server starts and stops Docker containers that run visitors' code.
An `<iframe>` serves as an on-page client for testing out Web apps.

The playground is packaged a systemd daemon.

<br>

To monitor logs on dream.as, run

```

```

To view the service status,

```

```

To view active sandboxes,

```
docker ps
```
