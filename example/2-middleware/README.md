# `2-middleware`

<br>

*Middleware* is just functions that take handlers and wrap them, producing
bigger handlers that do a little bit more. This example takes the handler from
[**`1-hello`**](../1-hello#files) and wraps it in one of the most useful
middlewares, the [*logger*](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#val-logger):

```ocaml
let () =
  Eio_main.run (fun env ->
    Dream.run env
      (Dream.logger (fun _ ->
        Dream.html "Good morning, world!")))
```

<br>

However, as you can see, the more middlewares we stack on top of each other
like this, the more parentheses and indentation we will end up with! To keep
the code tidy, we use `@@`, the
[standard OCaml operator](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Stdlib.html#VAL(@@)) for calling functions without parentheses. So, the [actual
code](https://github.com/aantron/dream/blob/master/example/2-middleware/middleware.ml)
in this example looks like this:

```ocaml
let () =
  Eio_main.run @@ fun env ->
  Dream.run env
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ fun _ -> Dream.html "Good morning, world!"
```

When you run this server and visit

[[playground](http://dream.as/2-middleware)], you get much more interesting
(and colorful!) output:

![Dream log example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aantron/dream/master/docs/asset/log-sanitized.png)

You can write your own messages to the log using
[`Dream.log`](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#val-log). See example
[**`a-log`**](../a-log#files) for more logging options. Now that we have the
logger, we will use it in all other examples, even though it's not really
necessary &mdash; it just makes it much easier to see what is going on.

<br>

There's not much else to middlewares &mdash; they are really just functions
from handlers to handlers, so you can create them anywhere. Example
[**`4-counter`**](../4-counter#files) already shows a simple custom middleware.

<!--
There are also more complicated middlewares defined in

- [**`m-locals`**](../m-locals/#files),
- [**`w-auto-reload`**](../w-auto-reload/#files), and
- [**`w-index-html`**](../w-index-html/#files).
-->

<!-- TODO Fill out this list; probably a-promise belongs here. -->

**Next steps:**

- The next example, [**`3-router`**](../3-router#files), shows
  [*routes*](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#routing), the other way to build
  up handlers in Dream.
- [**`4-counter`**](../4-counter#files) builds the first custom middleware.
