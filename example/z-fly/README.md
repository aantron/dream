# `z-fly`

This example deploys a very simple Dream
[application](https://github.com/aantron/dream/blob/master/example/z-fly/app.ml)
to [Fly](https://www.fly.io/), a hosting platform that scales and smartly moves your servers closer to your users. A low-usage app can be hosted for
[free](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#free-tier). Fly offers [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/), their CLI, that makes [deployment](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/start/) and  
[scaling](https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/) super simple.

```ocaml
let () =
  Dream.run ~interface:"0.0.0.0"
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.router [
    Dream.get "/" (fun _ -> Dream.html "Dream deployed on Fly!");
  ]
  @@ Dream.not_found
```

It uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so that you can
quickly expand it by adding databases and other services.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
    web:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        restart: always
        logging:
            driver: ${LOGGING_DRIVER:-json-file}
```

The setup can be run locally or on any server provider.

The
[`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/aantron/dream/blob/master/example/z-docker-esy/Dockerfile)
has two stages: one for building our application, and one for the runtime that
only contains the final binary and its run-time dependencies.

<br>

## Deploy

Fly has a really simple [setup guide](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/start/) that we'll follow.

1. Install `flyctl` with `brew install superfly/tap/flyctl`.
2. Run `fly launch` to initialize and deploy your project.

That should be it! Assuming no errors, the cli will share a link to your live app.

<br>

## Development

For local development you can run your app with or without Docker. Setting up the Docker build for the first time may take at least 4 minutes. Subsequent builds are cached.

<br>

**With Docker**

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. Ensure Docker is running, then run `docker compose up`. Docker should build, cache, and serve your app at `localhost:8080`.

**Without Docker**

1. Make sure you have [esy](https://esy.sh) installed.
2. Run `esy` to install all dependencies.
3. To start your app, run `esy start`. This is an aliased command setup inside `esy.json`.

-   [**`z-docker-opam`**](../z-docker-opam#files) is a variant of this example
    that uses opam instead of esy.
-   [**`z-systemd`**](../z-systemd#files) packages the app as a systemd daemon,
    outside of a Docker container.
-   [**`z-heroku`**](../z-heroku#files) deploys the app to
    [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
