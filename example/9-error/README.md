# `9-error`

<br>

You can easily customize *all* error responses generated by Dream, whether from
your application, or at lower levels in the HTTP stack. This is done by passing
the `~error_handler` parameter to
[`Dream.run`](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#val-run). The easiest way to get
an `error_handler` is to call
[`Dream.error_template`](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#val-error_template):

```ocaml
let my_error_template _error debug_info suggested_response =
  let status = Dream.status suggested_response in
  let code = Dream.status_to_int status
  and reason = Dream.status_to_string status in

  Dream.set_header suggested_response "Content-Type" Dream.text_html;
  Dream.set_body suggested_response begin
    <html>
    <body>
      <h1><%i code %> <%s reason %></h1>
      <pre><%s debug_info %></pre>
    </body>
    </html>
  end;
  Lwt.return suggested_response

let () =
  Dream.run ~error_handler:(Dream.error_template my_error_template)
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.not_found
```

<pre><code><b>$ cd example/9-error</b>
<b>$ npm install esy && npx esy</b>
<b>$ npx esy start</b></code></pre>

Try it in the [playground](http://dream.as/9-error).

<br>

We kept the error template simple for the sake of the example, but this is
where you'd put in neat graphics to make a beautiful error page!

<br>

Dream will call the error template for every single error response it generates:

1. `4xx` and `5xx` error responses returned by your application.
2. Exceptions raised by your application.
3. Whenever the lower-level HTTP servers want to send a response; for instance,
   a `400 Bad Request` due to malformed headers.

The `suggested_response` argument contains a skeleton response. It is either the
response returned by your application in case (1), an empty `500 Internal
Server Error` if your application raised an exception (2), or a `500 Internal
Server Error` or `400 Bad Request` suggested by the HTTP servers in response to
lower-level failures (3).

The easiest thing to do is to decorate `suggested_response` with a fancy
response body, and maybe add some headers. However, you can do anything here,
including return a completely new response.

<br>

`debug_info` is a multiline string containing the same information as in the
previous example, [**`8-debug`**](../8-debug#files).

<!-- TODO Images of the generated pages. -->

<br>

If you don't customize the error handler, Dream defaults to sending only empty
responses, so that your application can be fully localization-friendly &mdash;
even at the lowest levels. Rather than leaking hardcoded English strings, Dream
relies on the user's browser to display its own built-in, localized error pages.
This choice is also in accordance with the [OWASP Error Handling Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html).

**Next steps:**

- [**`a-log`**](../a-log#files) shows how to write messages to Dream's
  [log](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#logging).
- [**`b-session`**](../b-session#files) adds [session
  management](https://aantron.github.io/dream/#sessions) for associating state
  with clients.
